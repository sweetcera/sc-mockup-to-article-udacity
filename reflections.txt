You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. 

Answer the following questions:
  

* What new skills have you learned?
  
Honestly, none because I've been a web developer for 12 years and I do this every day.

* What has been easy?
  
HTML is really easy for me. I've been using HTML since I was 10 years old. 

* What has been difficult?
  
So far, nothing. I am looking forward to the Javascript sections of this Nano Degree and the version control part. 

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Just Google to remember how to do a strikethrough. Not something I think I've ever needed to use before.
